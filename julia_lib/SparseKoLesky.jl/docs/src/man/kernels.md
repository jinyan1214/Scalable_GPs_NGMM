# Kernel functions

A variety of handwritten kernel functions (also known as covariance functions)
can be found in
[CovarianceFunctions.jl](https://github.com/f-t-s/KoLesky.jl/blob/master/src/CovarianceFunctions.jl),
including Matérn kernels of half-integer smoothness and their derivatives.

This package is migrating to the [KernelFunctions.jl](https://juliagaussianprocesses.github.io/KernelFunctions.jl/stable/) interface however.
